# Datasets for Global Health
Aggregating datasets relevant to healthcare issues in the Global South.


## Datasets I'm working on

* mHealth applications deployed throughout the Global South
* COVID-19 Economic relief policies in African countries
* ...still thinking of more ideas!


### Collaborations
I believe there's a lot to learn from health data in the Global South and effective collection is a good first step. Generally speaking, I am interested in surveying, deploying, and integrating mHealth technologies in healthcare systems around the globe. If you are working on similar projects or share the same interests, I would love to collaborate. Please reach out!
