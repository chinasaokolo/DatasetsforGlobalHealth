# Datasets for Global Health
Aggregating datasets relevant to healthcare issues in the Global South.

## Datasets
Here are a list of intriguing datasets I've found so far:

### General Global Health
The World Health Organization (WHO) has a great list of datasets on maternal mortality, communicable diseases, mental heath, subtance abuse, health financing and much more! Check out their website along with the others I have listed below:

* [WHO Global Health Observatory](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.home)
* [Global Health Data Exchange](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/)
* [Health Intelligence Meta list of data sources](http://publichealthintelligence.org/content/resources/data-sources)
* [African Health Stats](https://www.africanhealthstats.org/)
* [Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Regional Health Observatory](https://www.paho.org/data/index.php/es/)


### COVID-19
* [COVID-19 Africa Intervention Dates](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/353MVB)
* [Line list of Coronavirus cases in Africa](https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19africa)


### HIV/AIDS


### Malaria, TB



## Datasets I'm working on
Like a lot of other researchers nowadays, I am interested in collecting data about COVID-19! Some of my current work with datasets revolves around this. Also, as a computer vision researcher, it's somewhat hard to find image or video datasets. I'm curating one at the moment for respiratory disease diagnosis, and definitely hope to share it in the future!

* mHealth applications deployed throughout the Global South
* COVID-19 economic relief policies in African countries
* Social distancing intervention dates in Latin America/Southeast Asia
* Social distancing intervention dates and cases per week in African countries
* ...still thinking of more ideas!


### Collaborations
I believe there's a lot to learn from health data in the Global South and effective collection is a good first step. Generally speaking, I am interested in surveying, deploying, and integrating mHealth technologies in healthcare systems around the globe. If you are working on similar projects or share the same interests, I would love to collaborate. Please reach out!
