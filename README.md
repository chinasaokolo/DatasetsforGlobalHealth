# Datasets for Global Health
Aggregating datasets relevant to healthcare issues in the Global South.

## Datasets
Here are a list of intriguing datasets I've found so far:

### COVID-19
[COVID-19 Africa Intervention Dates](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/353MVB)
[Line list of Coronavirus cases in Africa](https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19africa)


## Datasets I'm working on
Like a lot of other researches nowadays, I am interested in collecting data about COVID-19! Some of my current work on datasets revolves around this.

* mHealth applications deployed throughout the Global South
* COVID-19 Economic relief policies in African countries
* ...still thinking of more ideas!


### Collaborations
I believe there's a lot to learn from health data in the Global South and effective collection is a good first step. Generally speaking, I am interested in surveying, deploying, and integrating mHealth technologies in healthcare systems around the globe. If you are working on similar projects or share the same interests, I would love to collaborate. Please reach out!
