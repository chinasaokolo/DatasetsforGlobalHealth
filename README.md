# Datasets for Global Health
Aggregating datasets relevant to healthcare issues in the Global South.


## Datasets I'm working on

* mHealth applications deployed throughout the Global South
* COVID-19 Economic relief policies in African countries
* ...still thinking of more ideas!


### Collaborations
I believe there's a lot of potential for mobile health (mHealth) for the developing world and am interested in surveying, deploying, and integrating these types of technologies in healthcare systems around the globe. Here are some projects I am interested in pursuing in the future. If you are working on similar projects or share the same interests, I would love to collaborate. Please reach out!
