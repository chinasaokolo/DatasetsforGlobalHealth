# Datasets for Global Health
Aggregating datasets relevant to healthcare issues in the Global South.

## Datasets
Here are a list of intriguing datasets I've found so far:

### General Global Health
The World Health Organization (WHO) has a great list of datasets 

* [WHO Global Health Observatory](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.home)
* [Global Health Data Exchange](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/)
* [Health Intelligence Meta list of data sources](http://publichealthintelligence.org/content/resources/data-sources)
* [African Health Stats](https://www.africanhealthstats.org/)
* [Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Regional Health Observatory](https://www.paho.org/data/index.php/es/)


### COVID-19
* [COVID-19 Africa Intervention Dates](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/353MVB)
* [Line list of Coronavirus cases in Africa](https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19africa)


### HIV/AIDS


### Malaria, TB



## Datasets I'm working on
Like a lot of other researches nowadays, I am interested in collecting data about COVID-19! Some of my current work on datasets revolves around this.

* mHealth applications deployed throughout the Global South
* COVID-19 economic relief policies in African countries
* Social distancing intervention dates in Latin America/Southeast Asia
* Social distancing intervention dates and cases per week in African countries
* ...still thinking of more ideas!


### Collaborations
I believe there's a lot to learn from health data in the Global South and effective collection is a good first step. Generally speaking, I am interested in surveying, deploying, and integrating mHealth technologies in healthcare systems around the globe. If you are working on similar projects or share the same interests, I would love to collaborate. Please reach out!
